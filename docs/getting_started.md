# Welcome to Twidere

When you start Twidere for the first time, you can either *Sign In* or  *Register*. If you already have a Twitter account, continue with the [Sign In] instructions, otherwise continue with the [Register] instructions.

## Sign In

1. Tap _SIGN IN_

Twidere needs your Twitter credentials to be able to send and receive tweets. The "Browser Sign-In" screen lists what Twidere is able to do with your Twitter account.  It is important to read and understand the permissions that Twidere is requesting, before moving on to the next step.

2. Enter your Twitter username (or email address), and password, then tick the _Remember Me_ checkbox.

3. Tap _Authorize App_.

You should next see the "Account dashboard" message. This is a reminder that you can see, and edit, your account's settings by swiping from the left edge of the screen.
